# Server Monitor

A server monitor for JKA, but could be used for other Quake3-based games. Project is written in Java and used Swing for its GUI. 

I would like to credit [this post](https://tips4java.wordpress.com/2009/05/31/backgrounds-with-transparency/) as it helped me a lot with transparency issues.

Special thanks to [Lpion](https://github.com/Lpion) for giving me ideas, criticism, general support and motivation as he did a similar project with a couple more features and better looks.
